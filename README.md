GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

- WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information,
  THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
- WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML, THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
- WHEN I click on the GitHub username, THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
- WHEN I start the application, THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
- WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number, THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
- WHEN I select the engineer option, THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
